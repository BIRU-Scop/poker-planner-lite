# PokerPlannerLite

Simple app to run poker planning session in a scrum team
![Demo Timeout](docs/demo.gif)

Inspiration: [PlanningPokerOnline](https://planningpokeronline.com/)

The goal was not to reproduce all features of this app;
we only wanted the ability to join a room and vote.
And vote. And vote again.
Simplicity and usability is a must!

User need analysis:

We already have our own ticket tracker with weight that can be assigned to each issue.
We wanted a small supplementary tool just to run our poker planning session without needing any data retention in it.
Dev should be able to vote easily and PO should be able to observe the session
